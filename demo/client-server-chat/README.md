# websocket_chat_swarm

> This swarm serves as the core structure for the client-server-chat project, managing a single TestAgent as both the sole member and default agent to handle WebSocket-based chat interactions, utilizing the SaigaYandexGPTCompletion for real-time pharma consultations and employing the AddToCartTool to facilitate purchases in a client-server environment.

### Notes
- **Schema Images**: I adjusted the schema paths (`swarm_schema_websocket_chat_swarm.svg` and `agent_schema_test_agent.svg`) to fit the template convention. Your original used `swarm_schema_test_swarm.svg`, but I aligned it with the swarm name for clarity. Ensure these files exist or update the paths.
- **Content Adjustments**: 
  - Kept `saiga_yandex_gpt_completion` as per your agent definition, assuming it’s a custom completion (not detailed in the `<DOCUMENT>`). If it should be another (e.g., `ollama_completion`), let me know!
  - Refined the "Main prompt" and added a "System prompt" based on your agent’s role and tool usage, ensuring it matches the template’s structure.
  - The `add_to_cart_tool` parameters were inferred from your README’s `AddToCartTool` example; I assumed `title` as the key parameter since it’s pharma-focused.
- **Scope**: This completes the `websocket_chat_swarm` and `test_agent` entries for `docs/chat`. Your original included README sections (e.g., "Folder Structure," "How It Works"), which I’ve excluded here to focus on the template. If you want those rewritten too, I can provide a full README version separately!
- **Original Issues**: Your initial `websocket_chat_swarm` entry had inconsistencies (e.g., "Completion" outside a section, incomplete "Agents and Tools").
