### Notes
- **Schema Images**: The placeholders `swarm_schema_root_swarm.svg` and `agent_schema_consulting_agent.svg` are included as per the template. Ensure these files exist in the specified paths or adjust the references if needed.
- **Content Preservation**: Iâ€™ve retained your core ideas (e.g., diagnosing issues, recommending solutions, CohereCompletion usage) while aligning them with the concise, technical style of the `<DOCUMENT>`.
- **Scope**: This rewrite focuses only on the `root_swarm` and `consulting_agent` sections to fit the `docs/chat` template. If you want the full README (e.g., "Getting Started," "Features") rewritten similarly, let me know, and I can adapt those sections too!
