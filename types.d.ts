    /**
     * Emits a structured event to a specific client within the swarm system.
     * Asynchronously dispatches events to the designated `clientId`, enabling agents to notify the system of actions like message commits, tool executions, or output emissions.
     * Events follow a consistent schema extending IBaseEvent, including `type` (event identifier), `source` (originator, typically "agent-bus"), `input` (input data), `output` (result data), `context` (metadata with agentName), and `clientId` (redundant target ID).
     *
     * **Observed Behavior (from ClientAgent):**
     * - **Event Dispatch**: Events are emitted after significant actions, such as completing a stateless run (`"run"`), emitting validated output (`"emit-output"`), or committing messages/tools (`"commit-*"`).
     * - **Structure**: Every event includes a fixed set of fields, e.g.:
     *   ```javascript
     *   await this.params.bus.emit<IBusEvent>(this.params.clientId, {
     *     type: "commit-user-message",
     *     source: "agent-bus",
     *     input: { message },
     *     output: {},
     *     context: { agentName: this.params.agentName },
     *     clientId: this.params.clientId,
     *   });
     *   ```
     *   This notifies the system of a user message commit, with no output expected.
     * - **Asynchronous Delivery**: Returns a promise, implying events are queued or sent over a channel (e.g., network, in-memory queue), resolving when dispatched.
     * - **Client Targeting**: Always targets the client’s session ID (e.g., `this.params.clientId`), ensuring precise delivery to the intended recipient.
     * - **Notification Focus**: Primarily used for one-way notifications (e.g., history updates, tool stops), with `output` often empty unless carrying results (e.g., `"run"`, `"emit-output"`).
     *
     * **Example Usage in ClientAgent:**
     * - **Stateless Completion**:
     *   ```javascript
     *   await this.params.bus.emit<IBusEvent>(this.params.clientId, {
     *     type: "run",
     *     source: "agent-bus",
     *     input: { message },
     *     output: { result },
     *     context: { agentName: this.params.agentName },
     *     clientId: this.params.clientId,
     *   });
     *   ```
     *   Signals a completed stateless run with the transformed result.
     * - **Output Emission**:
     *   ```javascript
     *   await this.params.bus.emit<IBusEvent>(this.params.clientId, {
     *     type: "emit-output",
     *     source: "agent-bus",
     *     input: { mode, rawResult },
     *     output: { result },
     *     context: { agentName: this.params.agentName },
     *     clientId: this.params.clientId,
     *   });
     *   ```
     *   Broadcasts the final output after validation.
     *
     * **Key Characteristics:**
     * - **Redundancy**: The `clientId` in the event mirrors the emit target, aiding downstream filtering or validation.
     * - **Type Safety**: Generic `<T>` ensures events conform to IBaseEvent extensions (e.g., IBusEvent), supporting structured payloads.
     * - **Integration**: Paired with history updates (e.g., `history.push`) and callbacks (e.g., `onOutput`), amplifying system-wide awareness.
     *
     * @template T - The type of event, extending IBaseEvent, defining a structured payload with fields like `type`, `source`, `input`, `output`, `context`, and `clientId`.

/**
 * A higher-order function that ensures a provided function executes outside of existing method and execution contexts.

 * using `AsyncResource` to create a new, untracked async scope when necessary.
 *
 * @template T - The type of the function to be wrapped, extending any function with arbitrary arguments and return type.
 *   and executes it outside of any existing contexts if detected, otherwise runs it directly.
 * @throws {any} Propagates any errors thrown by the wrapped `run` function during execution.
 *
 * @example
 * // Basic usage with a simple logging function
 * const logMessage = (message: string) => console.log(message);
 * const safeLog = beginContext(logMessage);
 * safeLog("Hello, world!"); // Logs "Hello, world!" outside any existing contexts
 *
 * @example
 * // Usage with an async function
 * const fetchData = async (id: number) => {
 *   const response = await fetch(`https://api.example.com/data/${id}`);

 * };
 * const safeFetch = beginContext(fetchData);
 * safeFetch(42).then(data => console.log(data)); // Fetches data in a clean context
 *
 * @remarks
 * This utility leverages `AsyncResource` from Node.js’s `async_hooks` to create a new async scope when either
 * `MethodContextService.hasContext()` or `ExecutionContextService.hasContext()` returns true. This ensures the
 * wrapped function runs in an isolated environment, free from inherited context state, which is critical for operations
 * requiring a clean slate (e.g., resetting tracking in the agent swarm system). If no contexts are active, the function
 * executes directly without overhead. The `resource.emitDestroy()` call ensures proper cleanup of the async resource.
 *
 * @see {@link MethodContextService} for details on method-level context tracking.
 * @see {@link ExecutionContextService} for details on execution-level context tracking.
 * @see {@link https://nodejs.org/api/async_hooks.html#class-asyncresource|Node.js AsyncResource} for underlying mechanics.
