/**
 * Emits a custom event to the swarm bus service.
 *
 * This function sends a custom event with a specified topic and payload to the swarm's bus service, allowing clients to broadcast messages
 * for other components to listen to. It is wrapped in `beginContext` for a clean execution environment and logs the operation if enabled.
 * The function enforces a restriction on reserved topic names (defined in `DISALLOWED_EVENT_SOURCE_LIST`), throwing an error if a reserved
 * topic is used. The event is structured as an `ICustomEvent` with the provided `clientId`, `topicName` as the source, and `payload`.
 *
 * @template T - The type of the payload, defaulting to `any` if unspecified.
 * @param {string} clientId - The unique identifier of the client emitting the event.
 * @param {string} topicName - The name of the event topic (must not be a reserved source).
 * @param {T} payload - The payload data to be included in the event.
 * @returns {Promise<void>} A promise that resolves when the event is successfully emitted.
 * @throws {Error} If the `topicName` is a reserved event source (e.g., "agent-bus", "session-bus").
 * @example
 * await event("client-123", "custom-topic", { message: "Hello, swarm!" });
 * // Emits an event with topic "custom-topic" and payload { message: "Hello, swarm!" }
