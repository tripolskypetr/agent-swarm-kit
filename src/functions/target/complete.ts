 * Executes a single command in a swarm session and disposes of it, optimized for developer troubleshooting.

 * This function creates a temporary swarm session, executes a provided command, and disposes of the session upon completion.
 * It is designed for developer needs, such as testing tool execution or troubleshooting, with performance tracking and event bus notifications.
 * The execution is wrapped in `beginContext` for a clean environment and runs within an `ExecutionContextService` context for metadata tracking.
 * The operation is TTL-limited and queued to manage resource usage efficiently.

 * @returns {Promise<string>} A promise that resolves to the result of the command execution.
 * @throws {Error} If swarm or session validation fails, execution encounters an error, or disposal fails.
 * @example
 * const result = await complete("Calculate 2 + 2", "client-123", "MathSwarm");
 * console.log(result); // Outputs "4"
