/**
 * Interface representing an event bus for the swarm system.
 * Provides a mechanism for asynchronous, client-targeted event dispatching, primarily used by agents (e.g., ClientAgent) to broadcast operational updates, lifecycle changes, and outputs to the system.
 * Integrated into runtime parameters (e.g., IAgentParams, ISessionParams), the bus ensures decoupled communication between components, such as notifying clients of message commits, tool outputs, or execution results.
*/
export interface IBus {
  /**
   * Emits a structured event to a specific client within the swarm system.
   * Asynchronously dispatches events to the designated `clientId`, enabling agents to notify the system of actions like message commits, tool executions, or output emissions.
   * Events follow a consistent schema extending IBaseEvent, including `type` (event identifier), `source` (originator, typically "agent-bus"), `input` (input data), `output` (result data), `context` (metadata with agentName), and `clientId` (redundant target ID).
   * 
   * **Observed Behavior (from ClientAgent):**
   * - **Event Dispatch**: Events are emitted after significant actions, such as completing a stateless run (`"run"`), emitting validated output (`"emit-output"`), or committing messages/tools (`"commit-*"`).
   * - **Structure**: Every event includes a fixed set of fields, e.g.:
   *   ```javascript
   *   await this.params.bus.emit<IBusEvent>(this.params.clientId, {
   *     type: "commit-user-message",
   *     source: "agent-bus",
   *     input: { message },
   *     output: {},
   *     context: { agentName: this.params.agentName },
   *     clientId: this.params.clientId,
   *   });
   *   ```
   *   This notifies the system of a user message commit, with no output expected.
   * - **Asynchronous Delivery**: Returns a promise, implying events are queued or sent over a channel (e.g., network, in-memory queue), resolving when dispatched.
   * - **Client Targeting**: Always targets the clientâ€™s session ID (e.g., `this.params.clientId`), ensuring precise delivery to the intended recipient.
   * - **Notification Focus**: Primarily used for one-way notifications (e.g., history updates, tool stops), with `output` often empty unless carrying results (e.g., `"run"`, `"emit-output"`).
   * 
   * **Example Usage in ClientAgent:**
   * - **Stateless Completion**: 
   *   ```javascript
   *   await this.params.bus.emit<IBusEvent>(this.params.clientId, {
   *     type: "run",
   *     source: "agent-bus",
   *     input: { message },
   *     output: { result },
   *     context: { agentName: this.params.agentName },
   *     clientId: this.params.clientId,
   *   });
   *   ```
   *   Signals a completed stateless run with the transformed result.
   * - **Output Emission**:
   *   ```javascript
   *   await this.params.bus.emit<IBusEvent>(this.params.clientId, {
   *     type: "emit-output",
   *     source: "agent-bus",
   *     input: { mode, rawResult },
   *     output: { result },
   *     context: { agentName: this.params.agentName },
   *     clientId: this.params.clientId,
   *   });
   *   ```
   *   Broadcasts the final output after validation.
   * 
   * **Key Characteristics:**
   * - **Redundancy**: The `clientId` in the event mirrors the emit target, aiding downstream filtering or validation.
   * - **Type Safety**: Generic `<T>` ensures events conform to IBaseEvent extensions (e.g., IBusEvent), supporting structured payloads.
   * - **Integration**: Paired with history updates (e.g., `history.push`) and callbacks (e.g., `onOutput`), amplifying system-wide awareness.
   * 
   * @template T - The type of event, extending IBaseEvent, defining a structured payload with fields like `type`, `source`, `input`, `output`, `context`, and `clientId`.
   * @throws {Error} If emission fails, potentially due to invalid `clientId`, malformed event structure, or delivery issues (e.g., queue overflow, network failure).
