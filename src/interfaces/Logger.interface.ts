/**
 * Interface representing a logging mechanism for the swarm system.
 * Provides methods to record messages at different severity levels, used across components like agents, sessions, states, storage, swarms, history, embeddings, completions, and policies.
 * Logs are utilized to track lifecycle events (e.g., initialization, disposal), operational details (e.g., tool calls, message emissions), validation outcomes (e.g., policy checks), and errors (e.g., persistence failures), aiding in debugging, monitoring, and auditing.
