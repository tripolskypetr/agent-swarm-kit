/**
 * Service class for managing in-memory data for different sessions in the swarm system.
 * Provides a simple key-value store using a Map, associating SessionId (as clientId) with arbitrary objects, with methods to write, read, and dispose of session-specific memory data.
 * Integrates with SessionConnectionService (session-specific memory management), ClientAgent (potential runtime memory for agents), PerfService (tracking via logging), and SessionPublicService (public session API).
 * Uses LoggerService for info-level logging (controlled by GLOBAL_CONFIG.CC_LOGGER_ENABLE_INFO) during write, read, and dispose operations.
 * Acts as a lightweight, non-persistent memory layer for session-scoped data, distinct from StateConnectionService or StorageConnectionService, with no schema validation or persistence.
