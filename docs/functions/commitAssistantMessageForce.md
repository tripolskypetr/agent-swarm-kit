# commitAssistantMessageForce

```ts
declare function commitAssistantMessageForce(content: string, clientId: string): Promise<void>;
```

Forcefully commits an assistant-generated message to a session in the swarm system, without checking the active agent.
Validates the session and swarm, then proceeds with committing the message regardless of the current agent state.
Runs within a beginContext wrapper for execution context management, logging operations via LoggerService.
Integrates with SessionValidationService (session and swarm retrieval), SwarmValidationService (swarm validation),
SessionPublicService (message committing), and LoggerService (logging).
Unlike commitAssistantMessage, this function skips agent validation and active agent checks, providing a more aggressive commit mechanism,
analogous to cancelOutputForce vs. cancelOutput.

## Parameters

| Parameter | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `content` | The content of the assistant message to commit, typically generated by an agent. |
| `clientId` | The ID of the client associated with the session, validated against active sessions. |
