## ✨ Why Choose Agent Swarm Kit?

- 🧪 **Conversation Testbed**: Includes a unit testing framework with tool and agent override capabilities, enabling developers to simulate and validate agent interactions and tool integrations in isolated environments. ✅

- 🌐 **Model Context Protocol Ready**: Seamlessly connect agents to multiple remote MCP servers, allowing integration with external tools written in various languages (e.g., C#, Python) via the reusable Model Context Protocol, originally developed for Claude Desktop. 🔗

- ⚙️ **Automatic Client Session Orchestration**: Automatically manages client sessions, handling message history, agent navigation, and resource disposal for efficient and scalable real-time interactions. 🔄

- 👥 **Operator Support**: Supports navigation to human operators through tool calls, enabling seamless escalation of conversations from AI agents to human support for enhanced user experience. 🙋

- 🤖 **Swarm of OpenAI, Grok, and Claude in One Chat**: An agent-agnostic framework that allows a single chat to leverage multiple AI models (e.g., OpenAI, Grok, Claude) within a swarm, providing flexibility and diversity in agent capabilities. 🧠

- 📝 **Agent Schema to Markdown**: Generates Markdown documentation from agent schemas automatically in CI/CD, keeping project managers and teams updated on agent prompts, tools, and swarm structures without manual reporting. Changes are reflected instantly, streamlining communication and project tracking. 📊

- 💾 **Redis Storage Integration**: Persists state management, RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) search data, and chat history in Redis, ensuring reliable, scalable, and high-performance storage. This enables safe and consistent access to agent states, vector search results, and conversation histories across distributed systems (Microservices). 🗄️

- 🔄 **Chat Independent Background Agent Sessions**: Enables the swarm to perform complex data processing computations in isolated contexts, such as financial analytics, allowing agents to handle intensive tasks like market trend analysis or portfolio optimization without interfering with the primary chat flow. Works the same way like [fork in POSIX](https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009696799/functions/fork.html). 🔀

### Installation

Get up and running in seconds:

```bash
npm install agent-swarm-kit
```

### Quick Example

Here’s a taste of what `agent-swarm-kit` can do—create a swarm with a triage agent that navigates to specialized agents:

```typescript
import {
  addAgent,
  addCompletion,
  addSwarm,
  addTool,
  changeAgent,
  execute,
  session,
  Adapter
} from "agent-swarm-kit";

const NAVIGATE_TOOL = addTool({
  toolName: "navigate-tool",
  call: async (clientId, agentName, { to }) => {
    await changeAgent(to, clientId);
    await execute("Navigation complete. Notify the user", clientId);
  },
  validate: async () => true,
  type: "function",
  function: {
    name: "navigate-tool",
    description: "The tool for navigation",
    parameters: {
      type: "object",
      properties: {
        to: {
          type: "string",
          description: "The target agent for navigation",
        },
      },
      required: ["to"],
    },
  },
});

const ollama = new Ollama({ host: CC_OLLAMA_HOST });

const MOCK_COMPLETION = addCompletion({
  completionName: "navigate-completion",
  /**
   * Use whatever you want: NVIDIA NIM, OpenAI, GPT4All, Ollama or LM Studio
   * Even mock it for unit test of tool integration like it done in `test` folder
   * 
   * @see https://github.com/tripolskypetr/agent-swarm-kit/tree/master/test
   */
  getCompletion: Adapter.fromOllama(ollama, "nemotron-mini:4b"), // "tripolskypetr/gemma3-tools:4b"
});

const TRIAGE_AGENT = addAgent({
  agentName: "triage-agent",
  completion: MOCK_COMPLETION,
  prompt: "You are to triage a users request, and call a tool to transfer to the right agent. There are two agents available: `sales-agent` and `refund-agent`",
  tools: [NAVIGATE_TOOL],
});

const SALES_AGENT = addAgent({
  agentName: "sales-agent",
  completion: MOCK_COMPLETION,
  prompt: "You are a sales agent that handles all actions related to placing the order to purchase an item.",
  tools: [NAVIGATE_TOOL],
});

const REDUND_AGENT = addAgent({
  agentName: "refund-agent",
  completion: MOCK_COMPLETION,
  prompt: "You are a refund agent that handles all actions related to refunds after a return has been processed.",
  tools: [NAVIGATE_TOOL],
});

const TEST_SWARM = addSwarm({
  agentList: [TRIAGE_AGENT, SALES_AGENT, REDUND_AGENT],
  defaultAgent: TRIAGE_AGENT,
  swarmName: "navigation-swarm",
});

...

app.get("/api/v1/session/:clientId", upgradeWebSocket((ctx) => {
  const clientId = ctx.req.param("clientId");

  const { complete, dispose } = session(clientId, TEST_SWARM)

  return {
    onMessage: async (event, ws) => {
      const message = event.data.toString();
      ws.send(await complete(message));
    },
    onClose: async () => {
      await dispose();
    },
  }
}));

```

The feature of this library is dependency inversion for agents injection. The agents are being lazy loaded during runtime, so you can declare them in separate modules and connect them to swarm with a string constant 🧩


```typescript
export enum ToolName {
  TestTool = "test-tool",
}

export enum AgentName {
  TestAgent = "test-agent",
}

export enum CompletionName {
  TestCompletion = "test-completion"
}

export enum SwarmName {
  TestSwarm = "test-swarm"
}

...

addTool({
    toolName: ToolName.TestTool
    ...
})

addAgent({
  agentName: AgentName.TestAgent,
  completion: CompletionName.TestCompletion,
  prompt: "...",
  tools: [ToolName.TestTool],
});

addSwarm({
  agentList: [AgentName.TestAgent],
  defaultAgent: AgentName.TestAgent,
  swarmName: SwarmName.TestSwarm,
});

const { complete, dispose } = session(clientId, SwarmName.TestSwarm)

complete("I need a refund!").then(console.log);
```

## 🛠 Advanced Example: Vector Search with Embeddings

Integrate vector search with embeddings (RAG) for smarter agents:

```typescript
import { addAgent, addSwarm, addStorage, addEmbedding, session, Storage } from "agent-swarm-kit";
import { Ollama } from "ollama";

const ollama = new Ollama();

// Define an embedding with similarity calculation
const NOMIC_EMBEDDING = addEmbedding({
  embeddingName: "nomic_embedding",
  calculateSimilarity: (a, b) => {
    return tidy(() => {
      const tensorA = tensor1d(a);
      const tensorB = tensor1d(b);
      const dotProduct = sum(mul(tensorA, tensorB));
      const normA = norm(tensorA);
      const normB = norm(tensorB);
      const cosineData = div(dotProduct, mul(normA, normB)).dataSync();
      const cosineSimilarity = cosineData[0];
      return cosineSimilarity;
    });
  },
  createEmbedding: async (text) => {
    const { embedding } = await ollama.embeddings({
      model: "nomic-embed-text",
      prompt: text,
    });
    return embedding;
  },
});

// Set up storage with sample data
const TEST_STORAGE = addStorage({
  storageName: "test_storage",
  embedding: NOMIC_EMBEDDING,
  createIndex: ({ description }) => description,
  getData: () => JSON.parse(readFileSync("./data.json", "utf8")).slice(0, 100),
});

// Create an agent with storage
const TEST_AGENT = addAgent({
  agentName: "test_agent",
  completion: TEST_COMPLETION
  prompt: "...",
  storages: [TEST_STORAGE],
});

// Build the swarm
const TEST_SWARM = addSwarm({
  swarmName: "test_swarm",
  agentList: [TEST_AGENT],
  defaultAgent: TEST_AGENT,
});

// Talk with a client
const { complete } = session("client-123", TEST_SWARM);
complete("I need a refund!").then(console.log);

...

export interface PhoneModel {
    id: number;
    title: string;
    description: string;
    diagonal: number;
}

// Use vector search in a tool call
Storage.take<PhoneModel>({
  search: "8 inch phone",
  agentName: AgentName.TestAgent,
  clientId,
  storageName: StorageName.PhoneStorage,
  total: 1,
  score: 0.68,
}).then((phones) => console.log(phones));
```

## ❓ Orchestration Principles

1. 🤖 Several chatgpt sessions (agents) [execute tool calls](https://ollama.com/blog/tool-support). Each agent can use different model, for example, [mistral 7b](https://ollama.com/library/mistral) for small talk, [nemotron](https://ollama.com/library/nemotron) for business conversation. 🧠

2. 🌐 The agent swarm navigate messages to the active chatgpt session (agent) for each `WebSocket` channel [by using `clientId` url parameter](demo/client-server-chat/src/server.ts#L15) 🔗

3. 🔄 The active chatgpt session (agent) in the swarm could be changed [by executing function tool](https://platform.openai.com/docs/assistants/tools/function-calling). ⚙️

4. 📜 Each client sessions [share the same chat message history](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/messages/getMessage) for all agents. Each client chat history keep the last 25 messages with rotation. Only `assistant` and `user` messages are shared between chatgpt sessions (agents), the `system` and `tool` messages are agent-scoped so each agent knows only those tools related to It. As a result, each chatgpt session (agent) has it's [unique system prompt](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/messages/createMessage#messages-createmessage-role). 🗂️

5. 🛡️ If the agent output do not pass the validation (not existing tool call, tool call with invalid arguments, empty output, XML tags in output or JSON in output by default), the resque algorithm will try to fix the model. At first it will hide the previos messeges from a model, if this will not help, it return a placeholder like `Sorry, I missed that. Could you say it again?` 🚑

## ⚡ Multithreading

The following example demonstrates how to use a background agent to generate a Bitcoin trading report using a [fork-like mechanism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fork_(system_call)), ensuring the process runs independently of the main chat session:

```tsx
import { inject } from "../../../core/di";
import { TYPES } from "../../../core/types";
import { log } from "pinolog";
import { fork, overrideAgent, scope } from "agent-swarm-kit";
import { randomString, str, ttl } from "functools-kit";
import { SwarmName } from "../../../../enum/SwarmName";
import SwingRangeReportPrivateService from "../private/SwingRangeReportPrivateService";
import { AgentName } from "../../../../enum/AgentName";

const REPORT_TTL = 30 * 60 * 1_000;

export class SwingRangeReportPublicService {
  private swingRangeReportPrivateService =
    inject<SwingRangeReportPrivateService>(
      TYPES.swingRangeReportPrivateService
    );

  public getBtcReport = ttl(
    async () => {
      log("swingRangeReportPublicService getBtcReport");
      return await scope(async () => {
        overrideAgent({
          agentName: AgentName.ReportAgent,
          systemDynamic: async () => str.newline([
            `Current date/time: ${new Date().toISOString()}`,
            "In the report, be sure to write the date of the indicators you refer to.",
            "Give priority to the last relevant indicator in the report",
          ]),
          mcp: [],
        });
        return await fork(
          async (clientId, agentName) => {
            return await this.swingRangeReportPrivateService.getBtcReport(
              clientId,
              agentName
            );
          },
          {
            clientId: `swing-range-report_${randomString()}`,
            swarmName: SwarmName.ReportSwarm,
          }
        );
      });
    },
    {
      timeout: REPORT_TTL,
    }
  );
}

export default SwingRangeReportPublicService;
```

## 🔌 Tool and System Prompt Reflection

Enhance your LLMs with flexible, runtime-configurable tools and system prompts using `agent-swarm-kit`. The library allows you to define tools with dynamic interfaces, enabling agents to adapt their functionality based on context or agent-specific requirements. This makes it easy to integrate specialized capabilities, like fetching real-time data or generating reports without additional tool arguments, with minimal boilerplate. 🛠️

```tsx
addTool({
  toolName: ToolName.FetchShortRangeEmaSignals,
  type: "function",
  call: async ({ toolId, clientId, agentName, isLast }) => {
    const symbol = ioc.signalMetaService.getSymbolForAgent(agentName);
    const content =
      await ioc.shortRangeMathService.generateShortRangeReport(symbol);
    await commitToolOutput(toolId, content, clientId, agentName);
    if (isLast) {
      await execute("", clientId, agentName);
    }
  },
  function: (_, agentName) => {
    const displayName = ioc.signalMetaService.getDispayNameForAgent(agentName);
    return {
      name: ToolName.FetchShortRangeEmaSignals,
      description: `Fetch a short range EMA signals table for ${displayName}.`,
      parameters: {
        type: "object",
        properties: {},
        required: [],
      },
    };
  },
});
```

**Example**: Below is a tool that dynamically fetches short-range EMA (Exponential Moving Average) signals for a trading agent, with a description tailored to the agent's display name 🌐
